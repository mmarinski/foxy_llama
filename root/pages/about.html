                <p><strong>The Origins:</strong> The inception of Foxy Llama can be traced back to the serendipitous meeting of four visionary artists, each contributing their distinctive flair to the band's kaleidoscopic sound. In the spring of 2016, long-time friends and musicians, Luna Vega (vocals and synths) and Orion Silverman (guitar and production), stumbled upon a shared love for the psychedelic and vaporwave genres. They envisioned a musical project that would explore the boundaries of sonic exploration while creating an immersive experience for their listeners.With a clear vision in mind, Luna and Orion set out to complete their lineup with like-minded musicians. They were soon joined by the immensely talented drummer, Zen Allen, whose rhythmic prowess added a layer of intensity to the band's soundscapes. Completing the quartet was the versatile bassist, Nova Thompson, who infused the music with deep grooves and ethereal undertones. </p>
